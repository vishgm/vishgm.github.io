Welcome to the next part of the series - where we will cover more on the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) / Machine Learning (ML) in the banking domain!

## Agenda

What we will be covering in this post:
* How does AI / ML help banking institutions?
* What are some key use-cases which drives business value?
* Current and Future trends in adoption of AI

## Q) What are some key use-cases which drives business value?


* Loan Default Risk Prediction: ML models can predict the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan, helping banks make informed lending decisions. Below are some of the common scorecards / models built:

| Usecase                   | Objective                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Application Scorecard     | Assesses the creditworthiness of new loan applicants                                                         |
| Behavior Scorecard        | Evaluates the risk profile of existing customers based on their past banking behavior                        |
| Collections Scorecard<br> | Helps predict the likelihood of a customer responding to collection efforts and guides collection strategies |

* Fraud Detection: ML is critical for identifying and preventing various types of fraud, including identity theft, loan stacking, and first-party/third-party fraud

| Usecase                       | Objective                                                                                                                                                                             |
