The transformer architecture has revolutionized natural language processing since its introduction in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper. Let's break down its key components.

## Key Components

### 1. Self-Attention Mechanism
The heart of the transformer is its self-attention mechanism. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence:

$$
\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V
$$

### 2. Multi-Head Attention
```python
class MultiHeadAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, num_heads):
        super().__init__()
        self.num_heads = num_heads
        self.d_model = d_model
        self.d_k = d_model // num_heads
        
        self.W_q = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_k = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
        self.W_v = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
```

## Why Transformers Matter

1. **Parallelization**: Unlike RNNs, transformers can process all input tokens simultaneously
2. **Long-range Dependencies**: Self-attention helps capture relationships between distant words
3. **Scalability**: The architecture scales well with more data and compute
